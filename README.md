Trying to learn how to use Github without dying trying
## Something about me
I am Eliseo, a 26 year-old political scientist who is trying to learn statistics, data science and programming among other tools with the hope of having a **brighter future** (*I hope I don't die trying*) <br />My short-term objectives are:
1. Learn shit
2. Make money
